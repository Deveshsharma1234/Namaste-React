# Creating a Vite Application

To create a new Vite application, follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Create a new Vite project**:
    Open your terminal and run the following command:
    ```sh
    npm create vite@latest
    ```

3. **Follow the prompts**:
    - You will be asked to enter the project name.
    - Select a framework (e.g., React, Vue, etc.).
    - Choose a variant (e.g., JavaScript, TypeScript).

4. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```sh
    cd your-project-name
    ```

5. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

6. **Start the development server**:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```



Your Vite application should now be running, and you can start developing your app.
## Understanding `~` and `^` in `package.json`

In your `package.json` file, you might see version numbers prefixed with `~` or `^`. These are used to specify version ranges for your dependencies.

- **`~` (Tilde)**: This matches the most recent patch version (the third number) within the specified minor version (the second number). For example, `~1.2.3` will match all versions from `1.2.3` to less than `1.3.0`.

- **`^` (Caret)**: This matches the most recent minor version (the second number) within the specified major version (the first number). For example, `^1.2.3` will match all versions from `1.2.3` to less than `2.0.0`.

Using these symbols helps ensure that your project uses compatible versions of dependencies while still allowing for updates that do not introduce breaking changes.
