# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

# Food Vibe's Restaurant App

This project is a React application for **Food Vibe's**, a restaurant directory and ordering system. It utilizes React Router for navigation, lazy loading for improved performance, and Redux for state management.

- **Restaurant Menus:** View detailed menus for individual restaurants.
- **About Us:** Learn more about Food Vibe's.
- **Contact Us:** Contact information for Food Vibe's.
- **Grocery Section:** *(Placeholder)* A section for grocery items (currently under development).
- **Shopping Cart:** *(Placeholder)* A shopping cart for ordering food (currently under development).
- **Lazy Loading:** Improves initial load time by loading components only when needed.
- **Redux State Management:** Manages application state efficiently.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** The core JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router v6:** For client-side routing.
- **Redux:** For state management.
- **Vite:** A fast build tool.
- **CSS Modules (or similar):** For styling (assumed based on the project structure).
- **Lazy Loading:** For improved performance.
